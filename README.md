# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:**

I was hired at PyBer to help breakdown demographic statistics to evaluate regional performance. Our review covered driver for suburban, rural and urban cities, as well as fare rates associated within those regions.  

**Results:**

_Total rides_
Total rides were mostly concertrated in the urban city types (68.4%) which is mostly connectioned to the city-scape. Most people living in large cities do not have cars due to the difficulties surrounding parking and traffic. Subsequently, Suburban cities had approximately 26% of total ride share and rursl had approximately 5%.

_Total drivers_
Total driver followed a synonymous trend and yielded about 81% of total drivers, where as suburband was 16.5% and rural was 2.6%.

_Total fare by city type_
Total fares by city type results showed that a majority of the markey share comes from the Urban city typ at approximately 63%.

**Summary:**

Recommendations:
1. Work on onboarding more drivers in rural areas for easier accessibility for riders. 
2. With onboarding the cost per ride in rural areas would be significantly cheaper. 
3. Adressing some outliers in the urban rides. Synonymize the apporach with rural to bring to narrow regional performance.
